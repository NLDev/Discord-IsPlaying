Discord Self-Bot to change the "Is Playing" message

## Whats does it do? 

Well... As mentioned above, this is a small tool to change the "Is Playing" text in discord, without renaming any programs.<br>
Also, this text is forced. So it doesnt matter what you're actually playing.

## Stage

THIS IS IN BETA.

I wouldn't recommend using it yet.
